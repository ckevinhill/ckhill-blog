I read [this article](https://blog.immersed.team/working-from-orbit-39bf95a6d385) and was intrigued given that it presented a much more mature version of VR technology than I had percieved.  Like alot of people (I assume) I pictured VR being fuzzy, jinky and difficult to setup but the article painted a picture of a mature ecosystem that could be used for entertainment - but also for productivity.

So of course I had to immediately go and try this out.  A few of my initial experiences below.

## Cost

I went with the generally recommended Oculus Quest 2 which is expensive, but not outrageous ($299 USD).  Additionally you will likely need to spend an additional ~$100 USD on accessories to improve Quest 2 comfort and connectivity.

Games and Apps on Oculus are a bit pricey (~$20+ USD) given many of them are not quite as polished as other traditional gaming system games.  This is likely due to the smaller target audience and the pesky economies of scale.

## Setup

Ridiculously easy.  For both entertainment and productivity use-cases setup is extremely user-friendly.  The Quest 2 has clearly spent significant time in refining setup and has designed the unit to be standalone meaning almost no cables or dependencies are need for startup.

## Entertainment

Amazing.  While content is still a bit limited there are plenty of amazing moments where you feel somewhat astounded by the experience - both in videos, environments and games.  The device has been accessible for the entire family though we obviously need to provide some additional guidance to our 6 year old son (who once accidentally threw the controller across the room).

## Productivity

Mixed.  Immersed generally fulfills the promise of making your computer accessible within the VR environment and working (email, PPT, VS Code) and even teleconferencing can be done.  But I think I would struggle a bit to do more than 1 hour in VR at this point given:

* Some fuzziness around text
* Some discomfort from VR head-set
* Some lag from VR to computer interface at times
* Have to be very good touch-typer since can't see keyboard or mouse most of the time

Many of the above though are things I can possibly improve on - e.g. latency can be solved with Wifi Direct or a direct cable connection (vs. default Wifi connectivity) and discomfort can be likely fixed with improved accessories (currently in transit!).

## Summary

I feel like I have not lived up to my "early adopter" credentials here.  The VR technology is significantly better than I expected it to be and provides some moments that are quite literally amazing.  Use for productivity has promise but may still be a little rough on the edges without a good amount of customization but it does provide a clear picture of what the future of work could look like.
