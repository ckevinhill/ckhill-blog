## Paper

[Sustainable MLOps: Trends and Challenges](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9356947/) provides some high-level, initial exploration of the concepts of sustainability in the contect of MLOps and AI software.

## Data Points

* 75% of Data Scientists are not computer scientists by training
* 88% of Data Science teams are short of Data Engineers by a factor of 2

## Relevant Concepts

MLOps consists of:

* data ingestion/transportation
* data transformation
* continuous ML training
* continuous ML deployment
* output production/presentation to end-user

While many new tools being created, increased complexity (number of pieces or abstractions) yields decreased sustainability where sustainability could be:

* economic - i.e. creates economic value
* technical - i.e. enables ability to cope with changes
* environmental - i.e. avoids harm to environment it is in
* social - i.e. provides fair exchange of information between parties
